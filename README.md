* TASK 1 Data collection
 In this task we retrieved the data from https://api.magicthegathering.io/v1/cards in json format.
 Then we flattened the data, so that we can work in a tabular form we further analysis. Subsequently, we did some manipulation by excluding the colums that do not provide any additional information.




* TASK 2 Data Analysis
  In the task two we retrieved the dataset from the repository of our colleagues. the dataset is about a stock price historical information from binance.com. At first glance, the dataset seeems really well done. However, For the Data visualizations, we plot 4 graphs, namely: a barplot, boxplot,a line and a scatterplot.
  Then for the data manipulation, we used some basic commands of the tidyverse library like select,filter and summarise.

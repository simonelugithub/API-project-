**TASK 1 Data collection**
 In this task we retrieved all the data from https://api.magicthegathering.io/v1/cards in json format. We retrieved more pages in order to have a complete dataset. All the pages we retrieved, we merge them in a onlyone big dataset.
 We observed that the dataset had some ambiguities; so, we divided all the dictionary colums into the keys and values. Furthermore, we dropped all the columns that we consider not necessary for our analysis. Then we flattened the data, so that we can work in a tabular form we further analysis.


# TASK 2 Data Manipulation and Data Visualizations

**Python**

**R**
  In the task two we retrieved the dataset from the repository of our colleagues. the dataset is about a stock price historical information from binance.com. At first glance, the dataset seeems really well done. However, For the Data visualizations, we plot 4 graphs, namely: a barplot, boxplot,a line and a scatterplot.
  Then for the data manipulation, we used some basic commands of the tidyverse library like select,filter and summarise.
